# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Submission for this project includes the following:

1. A tidy data set.
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis.
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
4. A README.md file (which is this file) explaining how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
